Detailed Design Report (Communication between robots):

Robots shall communicate with each other and shall be remote-controlled from a computer. To achieve that, first we tried to use WiFi Technology using the two WifiBlocks provided with the robots. However, the only available wireless network was "wifinp", the network from ENSEEIHT. Since its use requires a special authentification, it was impossible to connect any robots to "wifinp". Then we tried to use a wireless ad hoc network but it also failed. Robots have integrated bluetooth and we considered using it but our computer did not have bluetooth adapters.
A team member eventually brought a router and we set up a local server that robots can connect to. We decided that robots will communicate with each other through that server and not using bluetooth technology at all. We installed a classic LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server in one computer because it was the easiest way to exchange data between a robot and a computer. Each robot has an unique local IP address stored in a SQL database.
A simple remote control interface was first developped with only basic commands (move forward, turn, stop). Next we include complex commands in the controller. Thus, we could control more precisely a robot and chose the distance it has to move, the degree turn and so on. Robots were also able to move following a wall with a certain distance. Every commands with their parameters are inserted into the MySQL database by the client. Robots can find commands it has to execute by reading a specific PHP page.
The final step was to send information from a robot to the server. It allowed us to deal with error messages when robots encounter obstacles and to check the correct execution of commands. Messages from robots are stored in a database and can be displayed on a PHP page.
